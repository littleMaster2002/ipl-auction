# ipl-auction
Creates a Fantasy IPL Auction scenario.

The program allows the user to simulate an IPL auction scenario where the user can either bid player-by-player or simulate the entire auction. Run the file to get started.

All data is from the IPL 2019 auction.
### How the IPL Auction works
* A maximum of 8 overseas players are allowed in a single squad.
* The squad size must not be larger than 25 players.
* All teams are allowed to retain players before the auction (this has already been done before the auction starts).
* All teams must remain within their budget - this includes the money they have already spent on retaining players.
* Each team usually aims to build a balanced squad with as much talent as possible.
